=================

A catalog is a structured collection or grouping of assets that are offered to users within a marketplace. It acts as a container that holds various types of assets, making it easier for users to browse, discover, and access the items they need.

Each catalog can have its own set of assets, such as plugins and workflows, which users can explore and utilize according to their requirements. By using catalogs, marketplace owners can enhance the user experience, making it more convenient for users to find and access assets related to their interests or needs.
