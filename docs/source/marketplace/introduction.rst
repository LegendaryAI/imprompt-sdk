About
=================

Imprompt allows customers to create their own internal or external marketplaces. These marketplaces are designed to streamline asset management and distribution, making it easier for users to share resources within their organization or with external partners. Let's delve into the key components and functionalities of this marketplace system.


Types of Marketplaces
==============================

**1. Imprompt Public Marketplace**


The Imprompt Public Marketplace is a centralized repository of assets, plugins, and flows that are available to all Imprompt users. A customer can share its assets, plugins, and flows with the public marketplace, making them available to all Imprompt users.


**2. Internal Marketplace**


An internal marketplace allows an organization to share, discover, and utilize various assets, plugins, and flows. It operates within the organization's private network and is accessible only to its employees or authorized members.


**3. External Marketplace**

An external marketplace allows an organizations to extend their collaborative efforts beyond internal boundaries. It serves as a bridge to share assets, plugins, and workflows with external partners, clients, and developers, fostering a wider ecosystem of knowledge exchange and cooperation.

Internal Marketplace Access
==============================

An internal marketplace admin can grant access to users based on their roles and responsibilities.

**Types of Internal Marketplace Access**

**Admin Access** Users with admin access have the highest level of control and authority over the internal marketplace. They can manage user permissions, create and delete catalogs, oversee asset contributions, and perform administrative tasks such as monitoring analytics and user feedback.

**User Access** Users with standard user access can browse the marketplace, search for assets, and utilize the available resources. They can access assets contributed by others and use them for their projects or initiatives. However, they do not have the ability to manage or modify assets within the marketplace.

**Developer Access** Some internal marketplaces may have a developer role, which grants users the ability to contribute assets to the marketplace. Users with developer access can add new plugins, workflows, or other resources, making them available for others to use.
